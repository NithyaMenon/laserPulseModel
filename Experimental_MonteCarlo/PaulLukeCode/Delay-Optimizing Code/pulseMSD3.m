function out = pulseMSD3(x,idealTimes,repRate)
% calculates the mean square displacement of digitized pulses from ideal
% pulses, 'idealTimes,' mod the laser repetition rate, 'repRate'
%
% All times are in nanoseconds.
%
% Inputs:
%  x - input from fmincon, containing the fractions of the repetition rate
%      at which the digital pulses will arrive, mod rep rate
%  idealTimes - the theoretically ideal pulse arrival times
%  repRate - the repetition time of the laser
%
% Outputs:
%  The function computes the sum of the squared time differences between
%  each ideal pulse and its nearest digital pulse. This function is
%  intended to be used as the input for a call to fmincon, which will
%  optimize the choice of digital arrival times.

% construct the possible delay lines in subfunction; add preceding and
% succeeding pulses as well for wraparound boundary conditions

% adjacent one, for each real pulse
