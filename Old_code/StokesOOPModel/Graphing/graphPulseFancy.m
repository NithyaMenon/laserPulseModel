hold on
% Choose the pulse colors, both the lines and the fill

              0.7 0 0    % dark red

% label with big fonts

% That looks much better, doesn't it?  Compare figure(1) to figure(5) to
% see how far we've come.

% the final trick is that to export it to a presentation, it is best 
% to first "print" it to a .png.  You can use the "Export Setup" submenu
% for this, but we've already fixed the fonts.  All we need is to 
% fix the size and print it.  Let's say we want it to be 4x3 inches.
% First we set the PaperPosition of the figure, whose handle is either 
% the figure number or "gcf" for the "current figure"
% set(5,'units','inches',...         % units could also be pixels, or normalized to the paper size
%       'PaperPosition',[0.1 0.1 4 3]);  % means put the figure 1 inch from the lower left corner, and make it 2x3
% % Then we print
% print(5,'-dpng',... % png format
%         '-r300',... % resolution 300 dpi
%         'sample_pulse_plot');  % filename
    
% This should generate the file sample_pulse_plot.png, which you can drop
% directly into PowerPoint, Word, or Acrobat.
